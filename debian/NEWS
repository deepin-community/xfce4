xfce4 (4.6.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  Xfce 4.6 includes multiple changes which are not directly visible to the
  user but might cause problems in rare cases.

  Settings management have been moved from the old MCS Manager to the xfconf
  system. User settings will be migrated automatically at first Xfce 4.6 
  startup using the /usr/lib/xfce4/xfconf-migration/xfconf-migration-4.6.pl
  script contained in xfce4-utils. Once those settings have been migrated,
  the automatic run will be disabled but the script will stay (for future
  users).

  Menus are now managed using a dedicated library, used by various Xfce
  components (including xfdesktop4 and the menu panel plugin). This library
  tries to support the freedesktop.org specifications, but is not totally
  complete and thus lacks the support for some items, like <Merge>.
  This renders useless the menu editor previously shipped with Xfce 4.4.
  Solutions for menu editing can be found at the following address:
  http://wiki.xfce.org/howto/customize-menu

  Xfce 4.6 now use freedesktop.org compliant icon naming spec. Rodent theme
  (contained in xfce4-icon-theme) is not freedesktop.org compliant, so if
  you use it in Xfce (or GNOME, or KDE 4) it will miss some icons here and
  there. You should now switch to Tango (in tango-icon-theme) or another
  freedesktop.org compliant theme.

  As the upgrade is pretty invasive, it is recommended to quit Xfce before
  doing so, but it's not required and upgrades have been made from the
  desktop environment without problems. In that case, be sure to quit Xfce
  not long after the upgrade.

xfce4 (4.3.90.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This is the 4.4beta1 release of xfce.  If you are running xfce at the time
  you do this upgrade please consider restarting very shortly afterwards.

  This is a major upgrade and as such you will lose some of your config - there
  is no sane way for us to avoid this.  Notably the panel config will need to
  be changed.  Also as this is a beta please consider reporting any bugs to
  upstream first or to both the BTS and upstream's bugzilla at
  http://bugzilla.xfce.org/

  Also #xfce and #debian-xfce on irc.freenode.net can be useful resources.
